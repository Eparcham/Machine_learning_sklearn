# 🧠 Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

Welcome to the **Machine_learning_sklearn** repository!  
This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand and implement core concepts of **Machine Learning (ML)** using the popular Python library **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 📚 About This Project

This repository contains hands-on Python examples, scripts, and notebooks covering the most essential parts of machine learning, all implemented using [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/). It's ideal for:

- Students studying ML fundamentals
- Professionals reviewing ML techniques
- Anyone who wants practical code to understand theory

The examples are structured and explained with simple, real-world datasets.
